List of files in the directory and their usage:
-----------------------------------------------

tp1.php : The page which has the actual elements where user movements have to be tracked.
All that is added and contains the functionality is the script tag with path to collector.js.
I could have come up with a better name :)

collector.js: The javascript file which has the url to mooculus.php and can be hosted in our server.
It contains functions for hover for mouse actions on a particular element and blur for keyboard events to text fields.
It then posts these tracking events to the couchdb database after building the data structure.
// TODO: Code cleaning. As of now badly written

mooculus.php: It contains the calls to insert and interact with the couchdb database. CouchDB was running on port 5894
while the webserver which hosted the file was on port 80. I think it should work for any setup.
// TODO: Code cleaning.


It is still a very simple implementation with minimal changes to the original page to be tracked. Only a path to
the collector.js file has to be added.

NOTE: Things like id and other fields are to be resolved. Can be done later.
As of now code is working fine.
