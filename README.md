mooculus
========

A Python/PHP/CouchDB addon to Track user activity.

Includes minimal changes to the original website.
Place the files in the www folder of the webserver.


Dependancies:
------------
CouchDB is installed: You will have to give the address,port number of the CouchDB server in the mooculus.php file
In collector.js , specify the location address of the mooculus.php file.

I think this is good to go.
